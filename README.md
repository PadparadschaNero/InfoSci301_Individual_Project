The original dataset I analysed is from https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/publicsector/leveraging-the-cloud-for-rapid-climate-risk-assessments/

The tool I use to regenerate the visualization is Amazon QuickSight https://dev.amazoncloud.cn/experience/cloudlab?id=66b57df20d1eb8781b9a77dd

The simulated dataset I use is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-climate-risk-index-and-related-economic-l

To replicate my experimental results, you just need to upload the simulated database in CSV format to the AWS QuickSight platform and select the Filled Map visualization feature to generate the visualizations.
